        <p><strong>Bio</strong><br>
            Hi! At the time of writing this I’m a sophomore in the Computer Science program at NDSU in Fargo. 
            I’ve been programming in my free time for the last few years and have picked up some skills in HTML/CSS/JS 
            , C++ (very basic and mainly for arduino), and my main language, Java. I was introduced 
            to programming through the FIRST robotics team in my hometown high school. I was not on the programming team but as it 
            was a small team I spent a lot of time with the people who were and realized just how simple programming actually was and how much I enjoyed the work. 
            I’ve worked on a variety of projects demanding a variety of skills however my favorites are usually when i'm working with 
            a team or am given a wide open problem with room to solve. I’m interested in a multitude of things from 
            music, to cars, to airplanes and avionics, and even rocketry. I’m always picking up new projects and hobbies and love 
            making things. And finaly I currently work at the Fargo Jet Center!
